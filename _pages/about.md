I am a research scientist at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/people/heng-wang) 
I was research scientist at Amazon Seattle, building computer vision systems for the "Just Walk Out" feature of [Amazon Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc>). 
Before moving to US, I was a postdoc in the [LEAR Team, INRIA](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/) with [Cordelia Schmid](https://thoth.inrialpes.fr/~schmid/).
I received my PhD in Computer Vision from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/) in 2012, and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2006.

My research interests range from low-level vision to high-level vision with a focus on video understanding. 
You can find more detailed information in my [CV](Heng_Wang_CV.pdf) and my [old homepage](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/).
